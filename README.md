## Things to have before we begin


# Disclaimer
I am not an AI expert! We are all learning and navigating this confusing landscape together. 


# Background Information 
## Large Language Models
A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence system designed to understand and create human-like content across various media types including text, images, video, etc. These models are trained on extensive datasets of diverse information. Using deep learning techniques, they recognize patterns and relationships within and between different forms of media.

In simpler terms, an LLM is a computer program that has been fed enough examples of human language that it can recognize and interpret human language and other forms of complex data. Many LLMs are trained on data that has been gathered from the internet and the quality of the samples impacts how well the LLM will learn natural language. 

There are many LLMs in existence such as OpenAI's high profile GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer). Some are optimized for specific purposes, as we will learn more about today, while others are more general use. 

## What is OLLAMA?

Ollama is an open source project that serves as a powerful and user-friendly platform for running LLMs on your local computer. Ollama simplifies the process of downloading, installing, and interacting with a wide range of LLMs


### Why?
You might be wondering, why would I want to run an LLM directly on my machine?

1. Privacy and Security

By processing information locally, Ollama ensures that your information remains secure and private. According to their [terms of service](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/), OpenAI claims they are not keeping and misusing your data. However, there are concerns about that. UVA licenses [UVA CoPilot](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=8a0050d847fac610bb2b9c7b116d4317), an instance of Microsoft CoPilot, which is probably safer to use. These are negated if you run the LLM yourself!

2. Offline Use

If you have a scenario where the internet is not available, such as use in the field, you can still run your AI models because it is saved on your local machine. Similarly, performance tends to be pretty good which is not always the case for services like ChatGPT.

3. Customizability

When using a sesrvice like ChatGPT, CoPilot, Bard, you **might** have a few options of what model to run. Ollama has a whole [library of models](https://ollama.com/library) to choose from, which can be used for different purposes. Some are general purpose models, some are specific to writing code, some are for creative purposes, some are for text generation, and more.

 4. Free

Ollama is free and open source. Paid services like ChatGPT, CoPilot, or Bard usually have a free tier of service but there are limitations to that. No such limits exist if you run it yourself. 

 5. Environmental Concerns
